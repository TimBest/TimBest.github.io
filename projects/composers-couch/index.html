  <h4>Authentication</h4>
  <p>
    'Sign up' and 'Login' terminology were chosen for their distinctness.
    They differ in the number of words and the starting letter allowing for quick scanning of the website.
  </p>
  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/homescreen.png" caption="'Sign up' and 'Login' forms are embedded into the home screen for quick access." %}
  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/auth_login.png" caption="Users are authenticated through Facebook, Twitter or an email address and password." %}
  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/auth_signup.png" caption="The zipcode field auto fills based on the users IP address. Future plans were to only ask for this field when a zipcode had not been found." %}
  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/auth_signup_social.png" caption="After signing up with social authentication users are prompted for needed information." %}

  <h4>Inbox</h4>
  <p>
    The users messages, private requests, public requests and show notifications are managed here.
    Messages could be sent internally through the site or to an email address.
    The idea was to reduce the time that it took to evaluate requests and schedule a date for them to play by providing: an integrated calendar, universally formatted press kits, and fan turn out metrics.
    Future plans included combining the rich content of filtered inbox's into one view and having one message form where public and private request are a single form instead of three forms.
  </p>
  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/inbox.png" caption="All messages can be viewed and accessed here." %}
  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/inbox_sent.png" caption="Any message sent or replied to can be found here." %}

  {% include screenshot.html url="/images/composers-couch/inbox_public_request_application.png" caption="Each public request has an attached thread for responding and working out details. Future plans were to add a 'Add to Calendar' form." %}

  <h4>Feeds</h4>

  <h4>Artist Profile</h4>
  <p>
    The Artist Profile main functionality was to serve as a universally formatted press kit.
