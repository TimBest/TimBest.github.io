  h3 First Attempt: The Moose Bag
  p
    | To make this bag I followed a
    a(href='DIY_chalk_bag_for_bouldering_or_climbing.pdf') pattern
    |     found at
    a(href='http://www.craftsy.com/pattern/sewing/accessory/diy-chalk-bag-for-bouldering-or-climbing/26523') craftsy.com
    |     with the following modifications:
    ul
      li
        | Lengthened the bag's lining to eliminate a sizable separation between the lining and the shell.
      li
        | Added clear nail polish to the ends of the draw string and ribbons to prevent them from fraying.
      li Cut out and ironed on a moose stencil to the outside of the bag.
    |     Other then that the pattern worked as expected and allowed me the make a great bag.

    | {{ macros.screenshot(url="/images/chalk_bag/assembly.jpeg", caption="Part way through the assembly we can see the shapes of each cut and how the fleece already looks a bit to small.") }}
    | {{ macros.screenshot(url="/images/chalk_bag/finished.jpeg", caption="Here is the bag fully assembled and ready for some climbing.") }}

    | For my next bag I plan to try this
