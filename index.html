  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    My name in Tim Best. I am origional from upstate New York and graduated from Clarkson University with a Bachelor of Science in computer science and a minor in mathematics.
    By trade I am a practicing Full-Stack web developer at <a href="//www.drchrono.com/" target="_blank">drchrono</a>; a Medical billing and Electronic Health Records statup based in Mountain View, California.
    Before working at drchrono I founded the start-up <a href="/projects/composers_couch/">Composer's Couch</a>, a website dedicated to improving how concerts are booked and promoted.
    Through these experiences I have developed a stronger sense of self motivation, improved my visual communication skills, and have acquired a deeper understanding of end user needs.
