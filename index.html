  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    My name in Tim Best.
    I am a software developer who graduated from Clarkson University with a Bachelor of Science in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I amcurrently living and working at drchrono in Mountain View California.
    Before this I have worked on a start up Composer's Couch, a website dedicated to improving how concerts are booked and promoted. While working on this project I enjoyed learning Python, executing best practices for Django, and researching how the music industry functions.
    Through this experiences I have developed a stronger sense of self motivation, improved my visual communication skills, and have acquired a deeper understanding of end user needs.
