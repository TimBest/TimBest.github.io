  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    My name in Tim Best.
    I am a software developer who graduated from Clarkson University with a Bachelor of Science in
    computer science and a minor in mathematics. For the past year and a half I have worked on the
    start up Composer's Couch, a website dedicated to improving how concerts are booked and
    promoted. While working on this project I enjoyed learning Python, executing best practices for
    Django, and researching how the music industry functions. Through this experience I have
    developed a stronger sense of self motivation, improved my visual communication skills, and have
    acquired a deeper understanding of end user needs.
